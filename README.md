### Description

Create and download plugins from your WordPress installation backend.
This is useful for example when you are developing in a local environment and want to get started quickly without the hassle of downloading online.
The plugin template used is based on [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/devinvinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate/)

Have discovered everytime i have to create a new plugin i had to go onto the internet and download a boilerplate copy and manually install. This can pretty much get old quickly especially if working on WordPress projects back to back.

##### Features:

* Save plugin details for use later

4. Access `/wp-admin/plugins.php?page=plugin-boilerplate` to start creating plugins
